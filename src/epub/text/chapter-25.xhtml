			<h2>
      Chapter XXV
    </h2>
<p>
      A few words more and I lay aside the pen for ever. Yet why should I not
      relinquish it now? All that I have said is preparatory to this scene, and
      my fingers, tremulous and cold as my heart, refuse any further exertion.
      This must not be. Let my last energies support me in the finishing of this
      task. Then will I lay down my head in the lap of death. Hushed will be all
      my murmurs in the sleep of the grave.
    </p>
<p>
      Every sentiment has perished in my bosom. Even friendship is extinct. Your
      love for me has prompted me to this task; but I would not have complied if
      it had not been a luxury thus to feast upon my woes. I have justly
      calculated upon my remnant of strength. When I lay down the pen the taper
      of life will expire: my existence will terminate with my tale.
    </p>
<p>
      Now that I was left alone with Wieland, the perils of my situation
      presented themselves to my mind. That this paroxysm should terminate in
      havock and rage it was reasonable to predict. The first suggestion of my
      fears had been disproved by my experience. Carwin had acknowledged his
      offences, and yet had escaped. The vengeance which I had harboured had not
      been admitted by Wieland, and yet the evils which I had endured, compared
      with those inflicted on my brother, were as nothing. I thirsted for his
      blood, and was tormented with an insatiable appetite for his destruction;
      yet my brother was unmoved, and had dismissed him in safety. Surely thou
      wast more than man, while I am sunk below the beasts.
    </p>
<p>
      Did I place a right construction on the conduct of Wieland? Was the error
      that misled him so easily rectified? Were views so vivid and faith so
      strenuous thus liable to fading and to change? Was there not reason to
      doubt the accuracy of my perceptions? With images like these was my mind
      thronged, till the deportment of my brother called away my attention.
    </p>
<p>
      I saw his lips move and his eyes cast up to heaven. Then would he listen
      and look back, as if in expectation of some one's appearance. Thrice he
      repeated these gesticulations and this inaudible prayer. Each time the
      mist of confusion and doubt seemed to grow darker and to settle on his
      understanding. I guessed at the meaning of these tokens. The words of
      Carwin had shaken his belief, and he was employed in summoning the
      messenger who had formerly communed with him, to attest the value of those
      new doubts. In vain the summons was repeated, for his eye met nothing but
      vacancy, and not a sound saluted his ear.
    </p>
<p>
      He walked to the bed, gazed with eagerness at the pillow which had
      sustained the head of the breathless Catharine, and then returned to the
      place where I sat. I had no power to lift my eyes to his face: I was
      dubious of his purpose: this purpose might aim at my life.
    </p>
<p>
      Alas! nothing but subjection to danger, and exposure to temptation, can
      show us what we are. By this test was I now tried, and found to be
      cowardly and rash. Men can deliberately untie the thread of life, and of
      this I had deemed myself capable; yet now that I stood upon the brink of
      fate, that the knife of the sacrificer was aimed at my heart, I shuddered
      and betook myself to any means of escape, however monstrous.
    </p>
<p>
      Can I bear to think—can I endure to relate the outrage which my
      heart meditated? Where were my means of safety? Resistance was vain. Not
      even the energy of despair could set me on a level with that strength
      which his terrific prompter had bestowed upon Wieland. Terror enables us
      to perform incredible feats; but terror was not then the state of my mind:
      where then were my hopes of rescue?
    </p>
<p>
      Methinks it is too much. I stand aside, as it were, from myself; I
      estimate my own deservings; a hatred, immortal and inexorable, is my due.
      I listen to my own pleas, and find them empty and false: yes, I
      acknowledge that my guilt surpasses that of all mankind: I confess that
      the curses of a world, and the frowns of a deity, are inadequate to my
      demerits. Is there a thing in the world worthy of infinite abhorrence? It
      is I. What shall I say! I was menaced, as I thought, with death, and, to
      elude this evil, my hand was ready to inflict death upon the menacer. In
      visiting my house, I had made provision against the machinations of
      Carwin. In a fold of my dress an open penknife was concealed. This I now
      seized and drew forth. It lurked out of view: but I now see that my state
      of mind would have rendered the deed inevitable if my brother had lifted
      his hand. This instrument of my preservation would have been plunged into
      his heart.
    </p>
<p>
      O, insupportable remembrance! hide thee from my view for a time; hide it
      from me that my heart was black enough to meditate the stabbing of a
      brother! a brother thus supreme in misery; thus towering in virtue!
    </p>
<p>
      He was probably unconscious of my design, but presently drew back. This
      interval was sufficient to restore me to myself. The madness, the iniquity
      of that act which I had purposed rushed upon my apprehension. For a moment
      I was breathless with agony. At the next moment I recovered my strength,
      and threw the knife with violence on the floor.
    </p>
<p>
      The sound awoke my brother from his reverie. He gazed alternately at me
      and at the weapon. With a movement equally solemn he stooped and took it
      up. He placed the blade in different positions, scrutinizing it
      accurately, and maintaining, at the same time, a profound silence.
    </p>
<p>
      Again he looked at me, but all that vehemence and loftiness of spirit
      which had so lately characterized his features, were flown. Fallen
      muscles, a forehead contracted into folds, eyes dim with unbidden drops,
      and a ruefulness of aspect which no words can describe, were now visible.
    </p>
<p>
      His looks touched into energy the same sympathies in me, and I poured
      forth a flood of tears. This passion was quickly checked by fear, which
      had now, no longer, my own, but his safety for their object. I watched his
      deportment in silence. At length he spoke:
    </p>
<p>
      "Sister," said he, in an accent mournful and mild, "I have acted poorly my
      part in this world. What thinkest thou? Shall I not do better in the
      next?"
    </p>
<p>
      I could make no answer. The mildness of his tone astonished and encouraged
      me. I continued to regard him with wistful and anxious looks.
    </p>
<p>
      "I think," resumed he, "I will try. My wife and my babes have gone before.
      Happy wretches! I have sent you to repose, and ought not to linger
      behind."
    </p>
<p>
      These words had a meaning sufficiently intelligible. I looked at the open
      knife in his hand and shuddered, but knew not how to prevent the deed
      which I dreaded. He quickly noticed my fears, and comprehended them.
      Stretching towards me his hand, with an air of increasing mildness: "Take
      it," said he: "Fear not for thy own sake, nor for mine. The cup is gone
      by, and its transient inebriation is succeeded by the soberness of truth.
    </p>
<p>
      "Thou angel whom I was wont to worship! fearest thou, my sister, for thy
      life? Once it was the scope of my labours to destroy thee, but I was
      prompted to the deed by heaven; such, at least, was my belief. Thinkest
      thou that thy death was sought to gratify malevolence? No. I am pure from
      all stain. I believed that my God was my mover!
    </p>
<p>
      "Neither thee nor myself have I cause to injure. I have done my duty, and
      surely there is merit in having sacrificed to that, all that is dear to
      the heart of man. If a devil has deceived me, he came in the habit of an
      angel. If I erred, it was not my judgment that deceived me, but my senses.
      In thy sight, being of beings! I am still pure. Still will I look for my
      reward in thy justice!"
    </p>
<p>
      Did my ears truly report these sounds? If I did not err, my brother was
      restored to just perceptions. He knew himself to have been betrayed to the
      murder of his wife and children, to have been the victim of infernal
      artifice; yet he found consolation in the rectitude of his motives. He was
      not devoid of sorrow, for this was written on his countenance; but his
      soul was tranquil and sublime.
    </p>
<p>
      Perhaps this was merely a transition of his former madness into a new
      shape. Perhaps he had not yet awakened to the memory of the horrors which
      he had perpetrated. Infatuated wretch that I was! To set myself up as a
      model by which to judge of my heroic brother! My reason taught me that his
      conclusions were right; but conscious of the impotence of reason over my
      own conduct; conscious of my cowardly rashness and my criminal despair, I
      doubted whether any one could be stedfast and wise.
    </p>
<p>
      Such was my weakness, that even in the midst of these thoughts, my mind
      glided into abhorrence of Carwin, and I uttered in a low voice, O! Carwin!
      Carwin! What hast thou to answer for?
    </p>
<p>
      My brother immediately noticed the involuntary exclamation: "Clara!" said
      he, "be thyself. Equity used to be a theme for thy eloquence. Reduce its
      lessons to practice, and be just to that unfortunate man. The instrument
      has done its work, and I am satisfied.
    </p>
<p>
      "I thank thee, my God, for this last illumination! My enemy is thine also.
      I deemed him to be man, the man with whom I have often communed; but now
      thy goodness has unveiled to me his true nature. As the performer of thy
      behests, he is my friend."
    </p>
<p>
      My heart began now to misgive me. His mournful aspect had gradually
      yielded place to a serene brow. A new soul appeared to actuate his frame,
      and his eyes to beam with preternatural lustre. These symptoms did not
      abate, and he continued:
    </p>
<p>
      "Clara! I must not leave thee in doubt. I know not what brought about thy
      interview with the being whom thou callest Carwin. For a time, I was
      guilty of thy error, and deduced from his incoherent confessions that I
      had been made the victim of human malice. He left us at my bidding, and I
      put up a prayer that my doubts should be removed. Thy eyes were shut, and
      thy ears sealed to the vision that answered my prayer.
    </p>
<p>
      "I was indeed deceived. The form thou hast seen was the incarnation of a
      daemon. The visage and voice which urged me to the sacrifice of my family,
      were his. Now he personates a human form: then he was invironed with the
      lustre of heaven.—
    </p>
<p>
      "Clara," he continued, advancing closer to me, "thy death must come. This
      minister is evil, but he from whom his commission was received is God.
      Submit then with all thy wonted resignation to a decree that cannot be
      reversed or resisted. Mark the clock. Three minutes are allowed to thee,
      in which to call up thy fortitude, and prepare thee for thy doom." There
      he stopped.
    </p>
<p>
      Even now, when this scene exists only in memory, when life and all its
      functions have sunk into torpor, my pulse throbs, and my hairs uprise: my
      brows are knit, as then; and I gaze around me in distraction. I was
      unconquerably averse to death; but death, imminent and full of agony as
      that which was threatened, was nothing. This was not the only or chief
      inspirer of my fears.
    </p>
<p>
      For him, not for myself, was my soul tormented. I might die, and no crime,
      surpassing the reach of mercy, would pursue me to the presence of my
      Judge; but my assassin would survive to contemplate his deed, and that
      assassin was Wieland!
    </p>
<p>
      Wings to bear me beyond his reach I had not. I could not vanish with a
      thought. The door was open, but my murderer was interposed between that
      and me. Of self-defence I was incapable. The phrenzy that lately prompted
      me to blood was gone; my state was desperate; my rescue was impossible.
    </p>
<p>
      The weight of these accumulated thoughts could not be borne. My sight
      became confused; my limbs were seized with convulsion; I spoke, but my
      words were half-formed:—
    </p>
<p>
      "Spare me, my brother! Look down, righteous Judge! snatch me from this
      fate! take away this fury from him, or turn it elsewhere!"
    </p>
<p>
      Such was the agony of my thoughts, that I noticed not steps entering my
      apartment. Supplicating eyes were cast upward, but when my prayer was
      breathed, I once more wildly gazed at the door. A form met my sight: I
      shuddered as if the God whom I invoked were present. It was Carwin that
      again intruded, and who stood before me, erect in attitude, and stedfast
      in look! The sight of him awakened new and rapid thoughts. His recent tale
      was remembered: his magical transitions and mysterious energy of voice:
      Whether he were infernal or miraculous, or human, there was no power and
      no need to decide. Whether the contriver or not of this spell, he was able
      to unbind it, and to check the fury of my brother. He had ascribed to
      himself intentions not malignant. Here now was afforded a test of his
      truth. Let him interpose, as from above; revoke the savage decree which
      the madness of Wieland has assigned to heaven, and extinguish for ever
      this passion for blood!
    </p>
<p>
      My mind detected at a glance this avenue to safety. The recommendations it
      possessed thronged as it were together, and made but one impression on my
      intellect. Remoter effects and collateral dangers I saw not. Perhaps the
      pause of an instant had sufficed to call them up. The improbability that
      the influence which governed Wieland was external or human; the tendency
      of this stratagem to sanction so fatal an error, or substitute a more
      destructive rage in place of this; the sufficiency of Carwin's mere
      muscular forces to counteract the efforts, and restrain the fury of
      Wieland, might, at a second glance, have been discovered; but no second
      glance was allowed. My first thought hurried me to action, and, fixing my
      eyes upon Carwin I exclaimed—
    </p>
<p>
      "O wretch! once more hast thou come? Let it be to abjure thy malice; to
      counterwork this hellish stratagem; to turn from me and from my brother,
      this desolating rage!
    </p>
<p>
      "Testify thy innocence or thy remorse: exert the powers which pertain to
      thee, whatever they be, to turn aside this ruin. Thou art the author of
      these horrors! What have I done to deserve thus to die? How have I merited
      this unrelenting persecution? I adjure thee, by that God whose voice thou
      hast dared to counterfeit, to save my life!
    </p>
<p>
      "Wilt thou then go? leave me! Succourless!"
    </p>
<p>
      Carwin listened to my intreaties unmoved, and turned from me. He seemed to
      hesitate a moment: then glided through the door. Rage and despair stifled
      my utterance. The interval of respite was passed; the pangs reserved for
      me by Wieland, were not to be endured; my thoughts rushed again into
      anarchy. Having received the knife from his hand, I held it loosely and
      without regard; but now it seized again my attention, and I grasped it
      with force.
    </p>
<p>
      He seemed to notice not the entrance or exit of Carwin. My gesture and the
      murderous weapon appeared to have escaped his notice. His silence was
      unbroken; his eye, fixed upon the clock for a time, was now withdrawn;
      fury kindled in every feature; all that was human in his face gave way to
      an expression supernatural and tremendous. I felt my left arm within his
      grasp.—
    </p>
<p>
      Even now I hesitated to strike. I shrunk from his assault, but in vain.—
    </p>
<p>
      Here let me desist. Why should I rescue this event from oblivion? Why
      should I paint this detestable conflict? Why not terminate at once this
      series of horrors?—Hurry to the verge of the precipice, and cast
      myself for ever beyond remembrance and beyond hope?
    </p>
<p>
      Still I live: with this load upon my breast; with this phantom to pursue
      my steps; with adders lodged in my bosom, and stinging me to madness:
      still I consent to live!
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I will rise above the sphere of mortal passions: I will spurn at the
      cowardly remorse that bids me seek impunity in silence, or comfort in
      forgetfulness. My nerves shall be new strung to the task. Have I not
      resolved? I will die. The gulph before me is inevitable and near. I will
      die, but then only when my tale is at an end.
