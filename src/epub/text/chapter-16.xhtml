      Chapter XVI
    </h2>
<p>
      As soon as I arrived in sight of the front of the house, my attention was
      excited by a light from the window of my own chamber. No appearance could
      be less explicable. A meeting was expected with Carwin, but that he
      pre-occupied my chamber, and had supplied himself with light, was not to
      be believed. What motive could influence him to adopt this conduct? Could
      I proceed until this was explained? Perhaps, if I should proceed to a
      distance in front, some one would be visible. A sidelong but feeble beam
      from the window, fell upon the piny copse which skirted the bank. As I
      eyed it, it suddenly became mutable, and after flitting to and fro, for a
      short time, it vanished. I turned my eye again toward the window, and
      perceived that the light was still there; but the change which I had
      noticed was occasioned by a change in the position of the lamp or candle
      within. Hence, that some person was there was an unavoidable inference.
    </p>
<p>
      I paused to deliberate on the propriety of advancing. Might I not advance
      cautiously, and, therefore, without danger? Might I not knock at the door,
      or call, and be apprized of the nature of my visitant before I entered? I
      approached and listened at the door, but could hear nothing. I knocked at
      first timidly, but afterwards with loudness. My signals were unnoticed. I
      stepped back and looked, but the light was no longer discernible. Was it
      suddenly extinguished by a human agent? What purpose but concealment was
      intended? Why was the illumination produced, to be thus suddenly brought
      to an end? And why, since some one was there, had silence been observed?
    </p>
<p>
      These were questions, the solution of which may be readily supposed to be
      entangled with danger. Would not this danger, when measured by a woman's
      fears, expand into gigantic dimensions? Menaces of death; the stunning
      exertions of a warning voice; the known and unknown attributes of Carwin;
      our recent interview in this chamber; the pre-appointment of a meeting at
      this place and hour, all thronged into my memory. What was to be done?
    </p>
<p>
      Courage is no definite or stedfast principle. Let that man who shall
      purpose to assign motives to the actions of another, blush at his folly
      and forbear. Not more presumptuous would it be to attempt the
      classification of all nature, and the scanning of supreme intelligence. I
      gazed for a minute at the window, and fixed my eyes, for a second minute,
      on the ground. I drew forth from my pocket, and opened, a penknife. This,
      said I, be my safe-guard and avenger. The assailant shall perish, or
      myself shall fall. I had locked up the house in the morning, but had the
      key of the kitchen door in my pocket. I, therefore, determined to gain
      access behind. Thither I hastened, unlocked and entered. All was lonely,
      darksome, and waste. Familiar as I was with every part of my dwelling, I
      easily found my way to a closet, drew forth a taper, a flint, tinder, and
      steel, and, in a moment as it were, gave myself the guidance and
      protection of light.
    </p>
<p>
      What purpose did I meditate? Should I explore my way to my chamber, and
      confront the being who had dared to intrude into this recess, and had
      laboured for concealment? By putting out the light did he seek to hide
      himself, or mean only to circumvent my incautious steps? Yet was it not
      more probable that he desired my absence by thus encouraging the
      supposition that the house was unoccupied? I would see this man in spite
      of all impediments; ere I died, I would see his face, and summon him to
      penitence and retribution; no matter at what cost an interview was
      purchased. Reputation and life might be wrested from me by another, but my
      rectitude and honor were in my own keeping, and were safe.
    </p>
<p>
      I proceeded to the foot of the stairs. At such a crisis my thoughts may be
      supposed at no liberty to range; yet vague images rushed into my mind, of
      the mysterious interposition which had been experienced on the last night.
      My case, at present, was not dissimilar; and, if my angel were not weary
      of fruitless exertions to save, might not a new warning be expected? Who
      could say whether his silence were ascribable to the absence of danger, or
      to his own absence?
    </p>
<p>
      In this state of mind, no wonder that a shivering cold crept through my
      veins; that my pause was prolonged; and, that a fearful glance was thrown
      backward.
    </p>
<p>
      Alas! my heart droops, and my fingers are enervated; my ideas are vivid,
      but my language is faint: now know I what it is to entertain
      incommunicable sentiments. The chain of subsequent incidents is drawn
      through my mind, and being linked with those which forewent, by turns
      rouse up agonies and sink me into hopelessness.
    </p>
<p>
      Yet I will persist to the end. My narrative may be invaded by inaccuracy
      and confusion; but if I live no longer, I will, at least, live to complete
      it. What but ambiguities, abruptnesses, and dark transitions, can be
      expected from the historian who is, at the same time, the sufferer of
      these disasters?
    </p>
<p>
      I have said that I cast a look behind. Some object was expected to be
      seen, or why should I have gazed in that direction? Two senses were at
      once assailed. The same piercing exclamation of HOLD! HOLD! was uttered
      within the same distance of my ear. This it was that I heard. The airy
      undulation, and the shock given to my nerves, were real. Whether the
      spectacle which I beheld existed in my fancy or without, might be doubted.
      I had not closed the door of the apartment I had just left. The
      stair-case, at the foot of which I stood, was eight or ten feet from the
      door, and attached to the wall through which the door led. My view,
      therefore, was sidelong, and took in no part of the room.
    </p>
<p>
      Through this aperture was an head thrust and drawn back with so much
      swiftness, that the immediate conviction was, that thus much of a form,
      ordinarily invisible, had been unshrowded. The face was turned towards me.
      Every muscle was tense; the forehead and brows were drawn into vehement
      expression; the lips were stretched as in the act of shrieking, and the
      eyes emitted sparks, which, no doubt, if I had been unattended by a light,
      would have illuminated like the coruscations of a meteor. The sound and
      the vision were present, and departed together at the same instant; but
      the cry was blown into my ear, while the face was many paces distant.
    </p>
<p>
      This face was well suited to a being whose performances exceeded the
      standard of humanity, and yet its features were akin to those I had before
      seen. The image of Carwin was blended in a thousand ways with the stream
      of my thoughts. This visage was, perhaps, pourtrayed by my fancy. If so,
      it will excite no surprize that some of his lineaments were now
      discovered. Yet affinities were few and unconspicuous, and were lost
      amidst the blaze of opposite qualities.
    </p>
<p>
      What conclusion could I form? Be the face human or not, the intimation was
      imparted from above. Experience had evinced the benignity of that being
      who gave it. Once he had interposed to shield me from harm, and subsequent
      events demonstrated the usefulness of that interposition. Now was I again
      warned to forbear. I was hurrying to the verge of the same gulf, and the
      same power was exerted to recall my steps. Was it possible for me not to
      obey? Was I capable of holding on in the same perilous career? Yes. Even
      of this I was capable!
    </p>
<p>
      The intimation was imperfect: it gave no form to my danger, and prescribed
      no limits to my caution. I had formerly neglected it, and yet escaped.
      Might I not trust to the same issue? This idea might possess, though
      imperceptibly, some influence. I persisted; but it was not merely on this
      account. I cannot delineate the motives that led me on. I now speak as if
      no remnant of doubt existed in my mind as to the supernal origin of these
      sounds; but this is owing to the imperfection of my language, for I only
      mean that the belief was more permanent, and visited more frequently my
      sober meditations than its opposite. The immediate effects served only to
      undermine the foundations of my judgment and precipitate my resolutions.
    </p>
<p>
      I must either advance or return. I chose the former, and began to ascend
      the stairs. The silence underwent no second interruption. My chamber door
      was closed, but unlocked, and, aided by vehement efforts of my courage, I
      opened and looked in.
    </p>
<p>
      No hideous or uncommon object was discernible. The danger, indeed, might
      easily have lurked out of sight, have sprung upon me as I entered, and
      have rent me with his iron talons; but I was blind to this fate, and
      advanced, though cautiously, into the room.
    </p>
<p>
      Still every thing wore its accustomed aspect. Neither lamp nor candle was
      to be found. Now, for the first time, suspicions were suggested as to the
      nature of the light which I had seen. Was it possible to have been the
      companion of that supernatural visage; a meteorous refulgence producible
      at the will of him to whom that visage belonged, and partaking of the
      nature of that which accompanied my father's death?
    </p>
<p>
      The closet was near, and I remembered the complicated horrors of which it
      had been productive. Here, perhaps, was inclosed the source of my peril,
      and the gratification of my curiosity. Should I adventure once more to
      explore its recesses? This was a resolution not easily formed. I was
      suspended in thought: when glancing my eye on a table, I perceived a
      written paper. Carwin's hand was instantly recognized, and snatching up
      the paper, I read as follows:—
    </p>
<p>
      "There was folly in expecting your compliance with my invitation. Judge
      how I was disappointed in finding another in your place. I have waited,
      but to wait any longer would be perilous. I shall still seek an interview,
      but it must be at a different time and place: meanwhile, I will write this—How
      will you bear—How inexplicable will be this transaction!—An
      event so unexpected—a sight so horrible!"
    </p>
<p>
      Such was this abrupt and unsatisfactory script. The ink was yet moist, the
      hand was that of Carwin. Hence it was to be inferred that he had this
      moment left the apartment, or was still in it. I looked back, on the
      sudden expectation of seeing him behind me.
    </p>
<p>
      What other did he mean? What transaction had taken place adverse to my
      expectations? What sight was about to be exhibited? I looked around me
      once more, but saw nothing which indicated strangeness. Again I remembered
      the closet, and was resolved to seek in that the solution of these
      mysteries. Here, perhaps, was inclosed the scene destined to awaken my
      horrors and baffle my foresight.
    </p>
<p>
      I have already said, that the entrance into this closet was beside my bed,
      which, on two sides, was closely shrowded by curtains. On that side
      nearest the closet, the curtain was raised. As I passed along I cast my
      eye thither. I started, and looked again. I bore a light in my hand, and
      brought it nearer my eyes, in order to dispel any illusive mists that
      might have hovered before them. Once more I fixed my eyes upon the bed, in
      hope that this more stedfast scrutiny would annihilate the object which
      before seemed to be there.
    </p>
<p>
      This then was the sight which Carwin had predicted! This was the event
      which my understanding was to find inexplicable! This was the fate which
      had been reserved for me, but which, by some untoward chance, had befallen
      on another!
    </p>
<p>
      I had not been terrified by empty menaces. Violation and death awaited my
      entrance into this chamber. Some inscrutable chance had led HER hither
      before me, and the merciless fangs of which I was designed to be the prey,
      had mistaken their victim, and had fixed themselves in HER heart. But
      where was my safety? Was the mischief exhausted or flown? The steps of the
      assassin had just been here; they could not be far off; in a moment he
      would rush into my presence, and I should perish under the same polluting
      and suffocating grasp!
    </p>
<p>
      My frame shook, and my knees were unable to support me. I gazed
      alternately at the closet door and at the door of my room. At one of these
      avenues would enter the exterminator of my honor and my life. I was
      prepared for defence; but now that danger was imminent, my means of
      defence, and my power to use them were gone. I was not qualified, by
      education and experience, to encounter perils like these: or, perhaps, I
      was powerless because I was again assaulted by surprize, and had not
      fortified my mind by foresight and previous reflection against a scene
      like this.
    </p>
<p>
      Fears for my own safety again yielded place to reflections on the scene
      before me. I fixed my eyes upon her countenance. My sister's well-known
      and beloved features could not be concealed by convulsion or lividness.
      What direful illusion led thee hither? Bereft of thee, what hold on
      happiness remains to thy offspring and thy spouse? To lose thee by a
      common fate would have been sufficiently hard; but thus suddenly to perish—to
      become the prey of this ghastly death! How will a spectacle like this be
      endured by Wieland? To die beneath his grasp would not satisfy thy enemy.
      This was mercy to the evils which he previously made thee suffer! After
      these evils death was a boon which thou besoughtest him to grant. He
      entertained no enmity against thee: I was the object of his treason; but
      by some tremendous mistake his fury was misplaced. But how comest thou
      hither? and where was Wieland in thy hour of distress?
    </p>
<p>
      I approached the corpse: I lifted the still flexible hand, and kissed the
      lips which were breathless. Her flowing drapery was discomposed. I
      restored it to order, and seating myself on the bed, again fixed stedfast
      eyes upon her countenance. I cannot distinctly recollect the ruminations
      of that moment. I saw confusedly, but forcibly, that every hope was
      extinguished with the life of CATHARINE. All happiness and dignity must
      henceforth be banished from the house and name of Wieland: all that
      remained was to linger out in agonies a short existence; and leave to the
      world a monument of blasted hopes and changeable fortune. Pleyel was
      already lost to me; yet, while Catharine lived life was not a detestable
      possession: but now, severed from the companion of my infancy, the
      partaker of all my thoughts, my cares, and my wishes, I was like one set
      afloat upon a stormy sea, and hanging his safety upon a plank; night was
      closing upon him, and an unexpected surge had torn him from his hold and
      overwhelmed him forever.
